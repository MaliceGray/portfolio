    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Maggie. Nice to see you here. I'm a web designer/developer based in the UK. I love colour.
    </p>
    <p>I have a First Class degree in Fine Art and moved into graphic design. But I wanted to see my static designs come to life - be interacted with and become dynamic. So I peeked into the diverse world of web development and haven't looked back...</p>
    <p>I have been working on various projects, from a time-mananagement app for kids to a random sentance generator. You can see examples of my work below</p>
